# CC2511_Assignment2_CNC

Code written by Ashley Mauro

This code is written and uploaded to a Raspberry Pi pico situated on a custom PCB shield created used to control a CNC Milling Machine.

The code encompasses a Manual mode and Gcode mode. While the Gcode mode is not actually a Gcode interpreter it is set up to interpret Gcode Coordinates.

Manual Mode utilises keyboard presses to move the CNC Milling machine while Gcode mode uses specific coordinates to move the CNC.

A Putty UI terminal is used to retrieve commands from the user.
